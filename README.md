# About

This is the Factual supported Ruby driver for [Factual's public API](http://developer.factual.com).


# Overview

## Basic Design

The driver allows you to create an authenticated handle to Factual. With a Factual handle, you can send queries and get results back.

Queries are created using the Factual handle, which provides a fluent interface to constructing your queries. 

````ruby
# You can chain the query methods, like this:
factual.table("places").filters("category" => "Food & Beverage > Restaurants").search("sushi", "sashimi")
  .geo("$circle" => {"$center" => [34.06021, -118.41828], "$meters" => 5000})
  .sort("name").page(2, :per => 10)
````

Results are returned as Ruby Arrays of Hashes, where each Hash is a result record.

## Setup

The driver's gems are hosted at [Rubygems.org](http://rubygems.org). 

You can install the factual-api gem as follows:

````bash
$ gem install factual-api
````

Or add one line to the Gemfile of your Rails project, and run `bundle`:

````ruby
gem 'factual-api'
````

Once the gem is installed, you can use it in your Ruby project like:

````ruby
require 'factual'
factual = Factual.new("YOUR_KEY", "YOUR_SECRET")
````
If you don't have a Factual API account yet, [it's free and easy to get one](https://www.factual.com/api-keys/request).
  
## Simple Read Examples

`````ruby
# Return entities from the Places dataset with names beginning with "starbucks"
factual.table("places").filters("name" => {"$bw" => "starbucks"}).rows
````

`````ruby
# Return entity names and non-blank websites from the Global dataset, for entities located in Thailand
factual.table("places").select(:name, :website)
  .filters({"country" => "TH", "website" => {"$blank" => false}})
````

`````ruby
# Return highly rated U.S. restaurants in Los Angeles with WiFi
factual.table("restaurants")
  .filters({"locality" => "los angeles", "rating" => {"$gte" => 4}, "wifi" => true}).rows
````

## Simple Places Example

````ruby
# Returns resolved entities as an array of hashes
query = factual.resolve("name" => "McDonalds",
                        "address" => "10451 Santa Monica Blvd",
                        "region" => "CA",
                        "postcode" => "90025")

query.first["resolved"]   # true or false
query.rows                # all candidate rows
````

````ruby
# Returns the nearest valid address information
query = factual.geocode(34.06021,-118.41828)
query.first
````

````ruby
# Returns georeferenced attributes generated by Factual
query = factual.geopulse(34.06021,-118.41828).select("area_statistics", "income", "housing")
query.first["income"]
````

## More Read Examples

````ruby
# 1. Specify the table Global Places
query = factual.table("places")
````

````ruby
# 2. Filter results in country US
query = query.filters("country" => "US")
````

````ruby
# 3. Search for "sushi" or "sashimi"
query = query.search("sushi", "sashimi")
````

````ruby
# 4. Filter by geolocation
query = query.geo("$circle" => {"$center" => [34.06021, -118.41828], "$meters" => 5000})
````

````ruby
# 5. Sort it 
query = query.sort("name")            # ascending 
query = query.sort_desc("name")       # descending
query = query.sort("address", "name") # sort by multiple columns
````

````ruby
# 6. Page it
query = query.page(2, :per => 10)
````

````ruby
# 7. Finally, get response in a hash or array of hashes
query.first    # return one row
query.rows     # return many rows
````

````ruby
# 8. Returns total row counts that matches the criteria
query.total_count
````
